👋 Hi! You have wandered into my personal website! My name is Shanti Stewart, and I'm currently on the market for PhD positions starting in 2025, in the area of deep learning for music & audio.

🎓 I recently graduated with a M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from [USC Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. Shrikanth Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8EDHmYkAAAAJ&hl=en) in the [SAIL](https://sail.usc.edu) lab. I worked on visual conditioning of music representations, image-to-music retrieval, and speech quality assessment.

🧑‍💻 I spent a substantial portion of my master's program interning in industry research labs. During my research internship at [Dolby](https://www.dolby.com/), I focused on controllable video-to-music retrieval and text-to-music generation. I also spent a summer at [Hume AI](https://www.hume.ai/), where I worked on expressive text-to-speech.

🔭 I am passionate about **machine learning for musical co-creativity**. As a longtime piano player and music lover, my goal is to create interactive AI systems that help musicians create, edit, and produce music. To facilitate this goal, my research interests are centered around two main themes: 1) **controllable and interpretable music generation** and 2) **multimodal music understanding**.

🎹 During my free time, I enjoy playing jazz piano, running, and skiing. I'm also a huge fan of spicy foods (especially Southeast Asian cuisine) and love trying new restaurants.
